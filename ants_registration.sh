# Orger Lab, 2017
# ANTs whole brain registration bash script
#
# usage: 
#     antsRunRegistration -f Template/Fixed Image -m Moving Image -a ANTsCallFile <other options>
#
#
# HARDCODED USER OPTIONS, ADJUST TO NEED
# -> ANTs_path
#   	Path to ANTs binaries
# -> thread_number
#   	Controls multi-threading. Set to the number of physical
#   	cores in the computer
# Updated 2019-2020.
# - Better/more verbose arguments
# - Usage of masks
# - Automatic transformation of Nth channels
#  - First channel image name must end in _01.[nrrd,nii.gz,tif] unless '-c' flag is used
#  - Nth channel image name must end in _0N.[nrrd,nii.gz,tif]
# Updated 2021.
# Channels are now figured out automatically, but must confirm to the patter:
#    basename_label.[nrrd,nii.gz,tif] with the '_label' being the key information.
#    'label' can be anything: '01' or 'terk' or 'a' as desired. The registration
#    will be driven by the image passed with the '-m' option.
# ~~Arbitrary warp and affine registration files cannot be used to drive transformations
# for arbitrary images, hopefully that is ready soon~~.
# Warp and affine files for their associated image can be in arbitrary locations if they are 
# passed with the '-r' and '-w' flags, otherwise the script looks at the current directory and
# the directory passed with the '-o' option
# Bridging should work, but is untested
# The script will look for files in the current directory, or in the subdirectory indicated
# by the '-o' option. Files will be saved into the current directory, or the directory
# indicated by the '-o' option.

Usage:

`basename $0` -f Template/Fixed Image -m Moving Image -a ANTsCallFile <other options>

Compulsory arguments:

-f: File name (including file type) of the template (fixed) image to be used as the 
	target space for the registration. '-a' can be substituted for '-f' if a bridging
	transformation is already fully computed for this input file.

-m: File name (including file type) of the moving image.

-a: antsCall file to used for the registration

-------------------------------------------------------

Optional arguments:

-d: Dry run. Outputs the full file names of the output images, but does not run a 
	registration.
	
-o: Output directory. Defaults to "registration".
	
-t: This controls the transformation of the various channels.
	0: don't run any transformations.
	1: Transform only the first channel/counterstain channel (often tERK).
	2: (Default) Transform all available channels that match the naming pattern of the 
	first channel.	

-h: print the Usage message for `basename $0`

-B: Set the bit depth of the transformed images to 16 bits.
	0: Use the native 32bit output of the ANTs transformation.
	1: (Default) Convert to 16bit output images.

-x: A single mask file to be passed to the registration. For now, this assumes
	that the mask will be applied to the fixed image. The mask should be an 8bit binary 
	mask with 1s where the registration should be applied, and 0s where it should be 
	excluded. The masking step does not seem to apply to the initial transformation step,
	so be careful when using it.

-p: The path to the ANTs binaries. Default is '/usr/bin/'.

-b: The bridging warp file to be used.

-w: A warp file that was previously generated by ANTs/ITK. This will be used to transform
	and images passed along with this. The file should be in '.nii.gz' format. Must be 
	passed with the -r option. **Note that the file stem for the warp must match the filestem
	for the moving image; arbitrary file names cannot currently be used.**
	
-r: A rigid initial alignment file previously generated with ANTs/ITK. This will be used to 
	transform and images passed along with this. The file should be in '.mat' format. 
	Must be passed with the -w option.

-A: The atlas template that is being bridged to. If '-b' is not set, this does nothing.

-T: Thread number. Set to the number of physical cores in the computer. On the cluster
	this could be 12. On a personal laptop this is likely to be 4.
